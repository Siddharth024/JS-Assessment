# 🖼️ NFT Minting Playground (Metacrafters - Beginning JavaScript)

This project demonstrates a basic JavaScript-based NFT (Non-Fungible Token) minting system. Built as part of the Metacrafters Beginner JavaScript assessment, it teaches foundational programming concepts such as object creation, arrays, loops, and function usage.

## 📚 Features

- Mint new NFTs with metadata (name, eye color, shirt type, bling)
- View the complete list of NFTs
- Get the total supply of minted NFTs

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Variables and Arrays
- Object Literals
- Functions
- Loops
- Console output

---

## 📦 Setup Instructions

1. Open the project in any code editor (e.g., VS Code).
2. Ensure your environment supports JavaScript execution (e.g., browser console or VS Code with Code Runner).
3. To run:
   - Select the code snippet.
   - Right-click and choose **“Run Code”** if using VS Code, or paste it in the browser console.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### `mintNFT(name, eyeColor, shirtType, bling)`
Creates an NFT object with the provided metadata and stores it in an array.

### `listNFTs()`
Prints out all NFTs and their metadata to the console.

### `getTotalSupply()`
Displays the total number of NFTs created.
